HOW TO USE?
# When the website is opened, the webpage visible is that of the "ABOUT US" section that speaks about the organisation "REACHING HAND". There are options such as:
	- ADMIN LOGIN
	- STAFF LOGIN
	- DONATE
	on the top-right corner of the website.
# On clicking on the ADMIN LOGIN, you will be taken to a login page where admin credentials will be asked for. These credentials are known only by the authorized admin of the organization and hence, there exists security and database privileges maintained.
# Once, the admin gives right login credentials, he will be logged in to get few more options such as:
	- ADD STAFF
	- ADD STUDENT
	- CHECK BALANCE SHEET
# As in a bank, inventory management is handled by one central administrator who either updates staff information or will update transaction information, even in this software, the admin gets to enjoy such elite privileges.
# If he chooses to ADD STAFF, he will be taken to a page where he will be asked to enter the staff information using forms,when submitted, the database gets updated. The same happens with the student addition to the database.
# When he chooses to view the check balance status, he will be taken to the other page where he will be asked to choose whether he see the overall transactions up-to-date or whether he wishes to see the approval requests from his staff or see the graph on his funds, expenses and donation, giving away relationships.
# When he chooses to view the transactions, the database will be displayed. When he wishes to see the requests from the staff, he can get to know who is requesting for what good and how much money and thereby can either accept the request and PAY the staff or not.
# On the other hand, the staff is given the privilege to make request for payments whenever necessary.
# In the donate option, the donor will be given a form to complete giving his details.
# The staff are automatically registered to Twilio, hence, they get to communicate with other staff through this platform.
